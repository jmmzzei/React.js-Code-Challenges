You think you know React, but how deep does your knowledge really go? In this installment of Code Challenges, instructor Ali Spittel provides several challenges to help you practice your React skills to see how much you’ve learned and how much you still need to know when working with this JavaScript library. Every challenge is self-contained and can be solved using React—no need for any other libraries—and you can jump around and complete them in any order you want. In each video, Ali provides her solution—one of several possible solutions—so you can compare to see how yours stacks up.

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
